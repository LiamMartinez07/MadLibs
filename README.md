Project description:
    This project was designed to replicate the popular Mad Libs word game. When you run the program you will be asked for different parts of speech,
    and you must respond accordingly. The program will then take your words, implement them into pre-existing sentences, and display the output to 
    you. Have fun!
Milestone chart:
    Creating all the sentences and creating the first indexOf. Estimated time: 20 minutes. Actual time: 10 minutes.
    Creating the first print statement and asking for user input. Completing the first indexOf. Estimated time: 30 minutes. Actual time: 20 minutes.
    Creating the second and third sections. Estimated time: 30 minutes. Actual time: 1.5 hours. 
    Finishing the program and printing the entire madLib, then testing. Estimated time: 30 minutes. Actual time: 1 hour.
My initial design notes were not very detailed because when I was designing the program I didn't know about substrings or indexOf statements yet, 
but part of my planning entailed figuring out what my personal mad lib was going to be and thinking about how I would get the index of < & > even
though I had already found them previously in the sentence.
